# Algorithms and Data Structures (Moscow IPT 4th term 2016)
- Solutions for geometric problems
- C++11 multithreading features testing
- 3D engine using "ray tracing" algorithm. Spheres and triangles, textures, point light sources supported. KD-tree(3D) for intersection finding. Multithreading(thread pull). Reading from stl, output into ppm.
